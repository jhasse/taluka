Taluka IDE
==========

Taluka aims to be an easy-to-use and extensible IDE written in Python and using
the Gtk+ toolkit. It's still in the beginning of development and not usable yet.

Gedit compatibility
-------------------

The goal is to be 100 % compatible with gedit's (Python) plugins. For this
reason always have a look at [gedit's plugin
API](http://live.gnome.org/Gedit/PythonPluginHowTo#Most_important_API) when
implementing new classes.
